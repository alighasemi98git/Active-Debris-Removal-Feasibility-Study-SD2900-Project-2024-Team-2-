##  Overview

This repository contains the feasibility study conducted by Team 2 for the **Active Debris Removal (ADR) Mission** project, part of the SD2900 Fundamentals of Spaceflight course at KTH (2024).

With increasing orbital congestion caused by launches and obsolete satellites, ADR has become a critical requirement for sustainable space operations. The study investigates **mission concepts, propulsion systems, capturing methods, launch strategies, and cost/sustainability aspects** of removing orbital debris from Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

##  Objectives

* Assess feasibility of lowering **10 rocket stages** from LEO to re-entry within **25 years**.
* Evaluate **mission timeline feasibility** with a maximum duration of **1 year**.
* Compare and select suitable **debris capturing methods**.
* Analyze **costs, technology readiness level (TRL), and sustainability factors**.

---

##  Key Findings

* **Ion propulsion (NEXT system)** is optimal for ADR due to high efficiency and durability.
* **Electrodynamic Tether (EDT)** is identified as the most suitable debris capturing method for rocket bodies.
* One single satellite is insufficient for mission requirements → **10 satellites proposed**, each dedicated to one debris target.
* **Falcon 9** chosen as the launch vehicle (Vandenberg launch site).
* Estimated **mission cost ≈ $223M** (including risk margin).
* Sustainability considerations highlight advantages of ion propulsion vs. chemical alternatives.
